# SER502 - Spring 2017 - Group 25
ASU SER502 Spring 2017 - Final Project (Group #25)

Given Requirements:

1. System on which your compiler and runtime are built (GNUstep, Linux, Unix,
Windows or MacOS).
2. Tools used
3. Directions/instructions to install your language.
4. Directions/instructions to build and run your language (compiler/runtime).
5. ONE LINE of bash script that builds the compiler and ONE LINE that runs the
runtime. (The exception to the above is for the teams who developed their language using Prolog, they need to provide two commands to run the language on Prolog Interpreter as opposed to command line of the machine.)
6. Link to the YouTube video

Instructions:

1. Any system that supports a SWI Prolog runtime.
2. SWI Prolog for the lexer, the parser, and the interpreter.
3. On Mac you can install SWI Prolog using "brew install swi-prolog\
4. Spark is invoked much like Python:
  ./spark [FILEPATH]
5.
  - To run as a lexer/parser/interpreter all-in-one:
    ./spark ../data/recursion.spark
  - To get the parse tree and evaluate in the in Prolog interpreter:
    1. Consult spark_core.pl using [spark_core].
    2. parse(Filename, Tree) gives the parse tree generated by reading the Filename.
    2. eval(Tree) evaulates the tree produce by the parse predicate.
6. @TODO FOR DAVID
